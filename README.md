🔑 Password: &ku=jlP2Gv%F

**TL;DR**
- A lightweight collection of curated phrase packs (CSV/JSON) and small utilities to help with everyday multilingual communication.
- Clear translations, optional transliteration and short context notes — designed for fast lookup and easy reuse.
- Friendly for contributors: add a small locale pack and help others.

**What is this**
GlobalPhrasePack bundles short, practical phrase collections and tiny helper tools focused on clarity and usefulness. Each pack pairs short English phrases with a local language translation, readable transliteration and a one-line usage note. The project targets learners, volunteers, community helpers and anyone who needs fast, shareable text snippets in multiple languages.

**Key features**
- Compact phrase packs (CSV/JSON) per locale: English ↔️ Local language.
- Transliteration field to help pronunciation (when native script may be unfamiliar).
- Short context notes for safe, correct usage (formality, region-specific cautions).
- Tiny, optional client utilities: search, copy-to-clipboard, simple formatters (currency, phone, date).
- Community-driven: easy to add new locale packs or improve existing entries.

**Why it works**
- Minimal friction: short phrases, immediate value.
- Low bandwidth friendly: small text files and lightweight UI.
- Practical focus: phrases written for real situations (greetings, directions, contact details, service requests, short confirmations).
- Trustworthy: entries prefer conservative, neutral wording and include usage notes.

**Examples (what users will see)**
- hello → नमस्ते (namaste) — friendly greeting, neutral form.
- where is the ticket counter? → टिकट काउंटर कहाँ है? (ticket counter kahaan hai?) — use in stations.
- I’d like to pay by UPI → मैं UPI से भुगतान करना चाहूँगा (main UPI se bhugtaan karna chaahunga) — polite phrasing for payments.

**Format & conventions**
- CSV/JSON fields: id, source, target, translit, notes
- Keep phrases short (ideally ≤ 8–12 words).
- Use plain ASCII transliteration for broad readability (avoid non-standard diacritics).
- Add a single-line note about formality / regional usage.

**Examples of a single entry**
- id: thank_you
- source: thank you
- target: धन्यवाद
- translit: dhanyavaad
- notes: polite and formal

**Usage scenarios**
- Quick copy-paste into messaging apps.
- Reference for community volunteers, helplines, or frontline staff.
- Lightweight offline phrase lookup in low-connectivity environments.
- Starter content for educational or localization projects.

**Contributing**
- Add a new pack: follow the CSV/JSON schema and include at least 20 useful phrases for the locale.
- Keep translations short and neutral; when possible, add transliteration and one usage note.
- Open a pull request with the new file and a short README update describing the locale.
- For large or sensitive topics (medical/legal), prefer conservative phrasing and request review from native speakers.

**Design & UX notes**
- Present short lists with copy buttons; show transliteration beneath native script.
- Highlight usage notes in a subtle grey to avoid clutter.
- Sort entries by everyday relevance: greetings, directions, payments, emergency basics.

**Privacy & safety**
- Phrase packs are static data — do not include personal or sensitive information.
- If the project is extended with a hosted service, inform users explicitly what is collected.
